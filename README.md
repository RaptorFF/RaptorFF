### About Me

👨‍🎓 **Master’s in Economics**  
After crunching numbers and solving economic mysteries, I decided to take a leap into the world of web development. Why? Because the web is just like economics—full of variables, surprises, and the occasional crash! 😅

🌱 **Fruit Farmer by Day**  
When I’m not coding, you’ll find me growing the juiciest peaches and freshest cherries on my farm. If you ever need fresh fruit or a healthy snack, you know who to call! 🍑🍒

💻 **Aspiring Web Developer**  
Currently sharpening my skills in:
- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript (the good parts and the weird parts!)
- Python
- React
- Node.js

I’m on a mission to build beautiful, user-friendly websites and apps. If you have any tips, memes, or bug fixes—send them my way!

⛷️ **Skiing Enthusiast**  
When winter calls, I trade my keyboard for skis and hit the slopes. I believe in writing clean code *and* making clean turns.

### Fun Facts

- I can debug your website and tell you the market price of peaches at the same time.
- My favorite algorithm? The one that finds the ripest fruit.
- I believe every project is better with a little humor and a lot of coffee ☕.

Thanks for stopping by!  
Let’s build something awesome (and maybe fruity) together! 🚀🍑
